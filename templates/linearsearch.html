        <h3>Main Logic</h3>
        <p>
            Linear Search is a straightforward searching algorithm that checks each element in the array sequentially 
            until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the array. It does not require the data to be sorted 
            and is often used when dealing with small or unsorted datasets. The algorithm continues to iterate through the 
            array until it finds the target or determines that it is not present.

        <h2>Linear Search Example Code</h2>
        <pre id="algorithmCode">
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return index
    return -1
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="mini-container">
        <h3>Algorithm Type</h3>
        <p>
            Linear Search is categorized as an internal search algorithm as it operates on data stored in memory (i.e., arrays).
        </p>
    </div>  

    <div class="mini-container">
        <h3>Time Complexity</h3>
        <p>
            The time complexity of Linear Search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This means that 
            in the worst case, the algorithm will need to check every element in the array to find the target value or 
            determine that it is not present.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mini-container">
        <h3>Space Complexity</h3>
        <p>
            The space complexity of Linear Search is O(1) because it only requires a constant amount of additional memory 
            space for variables used in the search process. This makes Linear Search suitable for situations where memory 
            usage is a concern.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mini-container">
        <h3>Comparison/Counting Search Algorithm?</h3>
        <p>
            Linear Search is a comparison-based algorithm, as it determines the position of the target value by comparing it 
            with the elements in the array. This approach contrasts with counting search algorithms, which do not require 
            comparisons and instead use counts to determine the position of each element. Linear Search is generally more 
            suited for small datasets, where its O(n) time complexity is acceptable.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mini-container">
        <h3>Algorithmic Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Linear Search follows a "Sequential Search" approach. It checks each element in the array one by one until it finds 
            the target or exhausts the array. This straightforward method is effective for small arrays but can become inefficient 
            with larger datasets.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="mini-container">
        <h3>Depends on Structure or Content?</h3>
        <p>
            Linear Search depends on the content of the data being searched, as it does not require any specific structure or order. 
            The efficiency of the algorithm is not influenced by the arrangement of the elements in the array, making it flexible 
            for various types of data.
